## üõ† Making Contributions

### Types of Contributions

We welcome various types of contributions:

- **Bug fixes** - Fix issues and improve stability
- **Features** - Add new functionality and capabilities
- **Documentation** - Improve docs, examples, and guides
- **Tests** - Add test coverage and improve reliability
- **Performance** - Optimize code and reduce resource usage
- **Query Language** - Enhance the query parser and add features

### Contribution Workflow

1. **Check existing issues** - Look for existing issues or create a new one
2. **Create a branch** - Create a feature branch from `main`
3. **Make changes** - Implement your contribution
4. **Add tests** - Ensure your changes are well-tested
5. **Test thoroughly** - Run all tests and verify functionality
6. **Submit PR** - Create a pull request with a clear description

## üìù Coding Standards

### Rust Style Guide

We follow standard Rust conventions:

- Use `cargo fmt` for consistent formatting
- Follow `cargo clippy` recommendations
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add documentation for public APIs
- Prefer explicit error handling over panics

### Code Organization

- Keep functions focused and single-purpose
- Group related functionality in modules
- Use appropriate visibility (`pub`, `pub(crate)`, private)
- Add comprehensive tests for new features

### Documentation

- Document all public functions and structs
- Include examples in documentation
- Update README.md for user-facing changes
- Keep comments concise and helpful

### Commit Messages

Write clear, descriptive commit messages:

```
feat(query): add support for regex patterns in queries

- Implement regex token parsing
- Add tests for regex functionality
- Update query language documentation

Closes #123
```

**Format**: `<type>(<scope>): <description>`

**Types**: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `test`, `refactor`, `perf`, `chore`

## üß™ Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests (excluding external service tests)
cargo test -- --skip judge_tests

# Run specific test suites
cargo test utils_tests     # Utility function tests
cargo test qb_tests        # API client tests
cargo test query_tests     # Query language tests

# Run with coverage
cargo tarpaulin --verbose --workspace --timeout 120 --skip-clean
```

### Writing Tests

- Add unit tests for all new functions
- Include edge cases and error scenarios
- Use descriptive test names
- Mock external dependencies when possible
- Avoid tests that require network access or external services

### Test Structure

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use crate::module::*;

    #[test]
    fn test_function_name_behavior() {
        // Arrange
        let input = "test input";
        
        // Act
        let result = function_name(input);
        
        // Assert
        assert_eq!(result, expected_output);
    }
}
```
